# Vehicle Vitals - Product Design & Feature Specifications

**Version**: 1.2
**Last Updated**: June 28, 2026
**Status**: 🟡 CORE SHIPPED — web and iOS core flows active; app/marketing alignment in progress (see docs/APP_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md)
**Owner**: Mark Nelson

---

## Document Relationship

This document describes product vision, persona definitions, tier structure, UX direction, and phased roadmap.

- Delivery truth for active releases is tracked in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- App and iOS changes needed to align with marketing direction are in `docs/APP_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md`.
- Planned and aspirational capabilities in this document are not implied as currently shipped.
- When delivery status differs between documents, defer to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` for implementation state.

---

## Product Vision

**Tagline**: "One garage for every vehicle record, reminder, and repair cost."

**Positioning**: Vehicle Vitals is a cross-platform vehicle management platform that lets owners track service history, plan upcoming maintenance, and build a credible ownership record — across personal vehicles, shared household vehicles, and light business fleets.

**Core value propositions**:

- **Proof when you need it**: Maintenance history for resale conversations, warranty claims, insurance discussions, and mechanic visits. A clean record makes every ownership moment more confident.
- **Fewer missed service moments**: Visibility into upcoming work before it becomes urgent or expensive. Planning beats reacting.
- **Plans that grow with the garage**: The same product works from a first vehicle to a household fleet to a light business — tiered to match the level of coordination needed.

---

## Personas

Vehicle Vitals serves five core personas. Each has a distinct pain point, outcome, and recommended tier path.

| ID | Nav label | Title | Pain | Outcome | Tier path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `owners` | Ownership Records | Ownership records | Records scattered; no clear service history | Keep every service record ready when it matters | Free → Pro |
| `households` | Shared Garage | Shared garage | Multiple vehicles, multiple drivers, no coordination | Coordinate every vehicle in one shared garage | Pro |
| `new-drivers` | Guided Setup | Guided setup | Unfamiliar with maintenance; uncertain what to do next | Know what to track from day one | Free → Pro |
| `diy-maintainers` | Hands-On Maintenance | Hands-on maintenance | No good way to document self-performed work | Document the work you do yourself, with receipts | Pro → Premium |
| `light-fleets` | Work Vehicles | Work vehicles | Vehicle spreadsheets; no operating visibility | Keep business vehicles ready, documented, and accountable | Premium → Enterprise |

Persona detail pages live at `/personas/:id`. Each page shows the pain/outcome narrative, a 3-step workflow, a recommended plan path, and a link to the relevant feature demo.

## Implementation Reality Snapshot (Code-Verified: June 28, 2026)

This document contains both product vision and delivery claims. The matrix below reflects current implementation evidence in the repository.

| Capability | Current Status | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-vehicle management | 🟢 Implemented | Web CRUD in `Home.tsx`, `AddVehicle.tsx`, `EditVehicle.tsx`; iOS in `firestore_service.dart`; active/stored status on both platforms |
| VIN lookup / auto-populate | 🟢 Implemented | Callable in `functions/src/index.ts`; web `AddVehicle.tsx` and iOS `ScanVinScreen` consume it |
| Maintenance logging + timeline | 🟢 Implemented | Web: `EditVehicle.tsx`, `TimelineDashboard.tsx`; iOS: `MaintenanceListScreen`, `TimelineDashboardScreen` |
| Document portfolio + AI analysis | 🟡 Partial (web only) | Web: full portfolio with file upload and analysis in `Records.tsx`; iOS: `RecordsScreen` exists but lacks analysis display and ownership insights — see APP_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md |
| Smart reminders (dismiss/snooze/complete) | 🟢 Implemented | Full lifecycle on web (`UpcomingTasks.tsx`) and iOS (`upcoming_tasks_screen.dart`); delivery outcome persisted |
| Reminder scheduling and delivery | 🟡 Partial | Scheduled sweep in functions; web manual send works; production delivery reliability not yet validated |
| Email + push notifications | 🟡 Partial | Email via `email.provider.ts`; web FCM in `notificationService.js`; iOS FCM in `notification_service.dart`; production reliability open |
| Calendar integration | 🟢 Implemented | Callable in functions; web and iOS both create calendar events (Google/Apple/ICS); provider-account validation still needed |
| Data export (PDF/CSV) | 🟡 Partial | Web: PDF + CSV in `dataExport.js`; iOS: `data_export_service.dart`; cross-platform output parity not formally validated |
| Service provider directory | 🟡 Partial (web only) | Web: `ServiceProviders.tsx` with location, radius, and type filters; iOS parity still needed |
| Four-tier subscriptions + entitlements | 🟢 Implemented | Web: `featureFlags.ts` + backend callable; iOS: `premium_service.dart` + subscription screen; production billing not yet validated |
| Marketing site + persona pages | 🟢 Implemented | 5 persona pages, 4 feature demos, pricing, help, video tours, screen gallery — deployed |
| App / marketing alignment | 🟡 In progress | See `docs/APP_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` — onboarding, Records nav, tier taglines, iOS portfolio parity are priority items |
| Fleet manager workflows | ⏸ Planned | Enterprise org plumbing exists; fleet dashboard and role controls not yet built |
| Budget forecasting depth | 🟡 Partial | Web: `CostAnalysisReportlet.tsx`; iOS: `analytics_screen.dart`; richer models and filters not yet built |

Legend:

- `🟢 Implemented`: production-capable in current code paths
- `🟡 Partial`: implemented in limited surfaces or missing complete UX/operational coverage
- `🔴 Not implemented`: interface or contract exists but behavior not built
- `⏸ Planned`: product intent only

## Subscription Tiers & Feature Gating

**Strategy**: Freemium model with four tiers. Each tier has a clear tagline that doubles as the positioning statement used in marketing copy and in-app upgrade prompts.

### Tier Overview

| Tier | Price | Vehicles | Tagline | Primary audience |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | Free | 2 | Learn and document | First-time users, single-vehicle owners exploring the product |
| **Pro** | $2.99/month | 10 | Plan and coordinate | Shared garages and active owners who want planning and calendar sync |
| **Premium** | $6.99/month | 25 | Forecast and automate | Hands-on maintainers, power users who want AI, exports, and API access |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 25+ | Govern and integrate | Work vehicle operators and business users who need policy controls and integrations |

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Free | Pro | Premium | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vehicles** | 2 | 10 | 25 | 25+ (contract) |
| **Maintenance reminders** | Basic (mileage) | Advanced (time + mileage) | Advanced + predictive AI | Org policies + automation |
| **Planning horizon** | 3 months | 12 months | 36 months | Fleet / portfolio planning |
| **Calendar sync** | — | Google / Apple / ICS | All platforms | Org-wide |
| **Document portfolio & analysis** | Basic | Full | Full + cloud sync | Full + policy controls |
| **Export formats** | CSV | PDF, CSV | PDF, CSV, Excel | Accounting-grade + scheduled |

| **API access** | — | — | Zapier / webhook | ERP integrations |
| **Ads** | Yes | Reduced | None | None |
| **Support** | Standard email | Email (48h) | Email (8h) | Dedicated success + SLA |

### Upgrade Trigger Points (UX Design)

**Free → Pro Trigger**:

- User attempts to add 3rd vehicle → "Add more vehicles with Pro"
- User attempts to enable calendar sync → "Calendar sync is a Pro feature"
- User attempts to upload 11th receipt → "Unlimited uploads with Pro"

**Pro → Premium Trigger**:

- Power user (10+ vehicles) views Pro limit → "Manage more vehicles with Premium"
- User attempts unlimited AI analysis → "Unlimited AI with Premium"
- User attempts API access → "Integrations available with Premium"

**Ad Reduction as Motivation**:

- Premium tier prominently marketed as "Ad-free experience"
- Pro tier shows: "Fewer ads (1-2 vs 3-5)"

### Ad Placement Strategy by Tier

**Free Tier (3-5 Ad Placements)**:

1. Dashboard banner (320x50 mobile, 728x90 web)
2. Sidebar rectangle (300x600 desktop)
3. Below maintenance history (300x250)
4. Within reminders (native)
5. Export report footer (728x90)

**Pro Tier (1-2 Ad Placements)**:

- Sidebar removed (main revenue trade)
- Reduced frequency: dashboard banner rotates daily instead of hourly
- Below maintenance history removed
- Reminders ad-free

**Premium Tier (0-1 Ad Placements)**:

- Fully ad-free experience
- Maximum UX polish
- Optional: "Sponsored content" section (educational, non-intrusive)

**Enterprise Tier**:

- Contracted, sales-led deployment
- Org-wide controls and support handoff
- No consumer ad placements

See [`docs/MONETIZATION_STRATEGY.md`](MONETIZATION_STRATEGY.md) for detailed ad placement specifications and CPM targets.

## 🎨 Design Language & UX Principles

### Design Principles

1. **Trust & Reliability**: Utility app demands confidence (accurate data, secure storage, transparent operations)
2. **Quick Access**: Minimal taps to see vehicle status or access critical info
3. **Clear Organization**: Vehicle-scoped hierarchy (multiple vehicles clearly separated)
4. **Actionable Insights**: Alerts prioritize what needs immediate attention
5. **Compliance Confidence**: Make it obvious when warranty is protected or compliance is met

### Visual Language

**Color Palette**:

- Primary: Navy Blue (#1E3A8A) - trust, stability
- Success: Green (#10B981) - maintenance complete, safe to drive
- Alert: Amber (#F59E0B) - maintenance due soon
- Critical: Red (#EF4444) - urgent attention required, do not delay
- Neutral: Gray (#6B7280) - archive, history, past records

**Typography**:

- Headers: Inter, Montserrat (modern, professional)
- Body: System fonts (SF Pro Display iOS, Roboto Android) - accessible, legible
- Data: Monospace (vehicle data, VINs, cost breakdowns)

**UI Components**:

- Vehicle Cards: Standard card with vehicle image, quick stats
- Maintenance Timeline: Chronological left-aligned visual timeline
- Alerts: Prominent, color-coded, dismissible
- CTA Buttons: Clear action (Log Maintenance, Schedule Service)

---

## 👥 User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary User: "Responsible Vehicle Owner"

**Scenario**: Monthly vehicle maintenance check

1. Opens app to check vehicle status
2. Views maintenance timeline (see past 6 months)
3. Sees alert: "Oil change due in 500 miles"
4. Plans next service appointment
5. Sets reminder
6. Closes app until next appointment

**Pain Points Addressed**:

- Forgotten maintenance schedules (prevented by alerts)
- Lost maintenance records (centralized storage)
- Warranty anxiety (proof of maintenance)
- Budget surprises (cost tracking and forecasting)

---

### Secondary User: "Fleet Manager"

**Scenario**: Weekly fleet oversight

1. Opens app dashboard (all vehicles at glance)
2. Reviews upcoming maintenance across fleet
3. Prioritizes which vehicle needs service first (by cost, urgency)
4. Sends service reminders to drivers
5. Tracks cumulative maintenance costs for budget
6. Exports maintenance report for compliance

**Pain Points Addressed**:

- No visibility into fleet health (centralized dashboard)
- Coordination challenges across drivers (assignment system)
- Cost control (budget tracking per vehicle, department)
- Compliance documentation (easy export for audits)

---

### Tertiary User: "Young Vehicle Owner"

**Scenario**: First vehicle, learning maintenance responsibility

1. Opens app, unsure what "O2 sensor" means
2. Views maintenance details with plain-language explanations
3. Reads: "O2 sensor improves fuel efficiency and emissions"
4. Sees cost estimate: "$300-500 repair"
5. Decides to schedule service, makes appointment
6. Tracks progress until completion

**Pain Points Addressed**:

- Mechanical intimidation (plain language explanations)
- Price shock (cost estimates from community)
- Decision paralysis (education + price transparency)
- Accountability (reminder system prevents procrastination)

## 🧭 Capability Vocabulary

The sketch above predates the capability and information-architecture
refactor (`docs/CAPABILITY_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_PROMPT.md`) and is kept as
historical context, not a literal current map. The canonical vocabulary
below is what web and mobile navigation, analytics, and Help are actually
built against today.

### Canonical capabilities

| Capability ID | Full label | Compact label (mobile) | Web route | Mobile route |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `getting_started` | Getting Started | Getting Started | `/getting-started` | *(no single screen — onboarding entry point)* |
| `garage` | Garage | Garage | `/app` | `/app` |
| `service_history` | Service History | History | `/app/timeline` | `/app/timeline` |
| `maintenance_plan` | Maintenance Plan | Plan | `/app/upcoming` | `/app/upcoming` |
| `shops_services` | Shops & Services | Shops & Services | `/app/providers` | `/app/service-providers` |
| `account` | Account | Account | `/app/profile` | `/app/profile` |

Defined once per platform — `packages/web/src/data/capabilities.ts` (TS) and
`packages/mobile/lib/data/capabilities.dart` (Dart) — deliberately as two
parallel plain-literal definitions rather than a single generated artifact,
kept in sync by a contract test
(`packages/web/src/data/__tests__/capabilities.contract.test.ts`) that reads
the Dart file as text and asserts a 1:1 match against the TS array.

### Public vs. authenticated navigation

- **Logged-out (public) nav**: persona links (Ownership Records, Shared
  Garage, Guided Setup, Hands-On Maintenance, Work Vehicles) plus Login/Sign
  Up. Pricing and Product Tour live in the footer, not the header.
- **Authenticated nav** (header and footer): every capability with
  `surfaces.authNav: true`, in `order` — Getting Started, Garage, Service
  History, Maintenance Plan, Shops & Services, Account. Getting Started and
  Product Tour are evaluation-stage content and are hidden from the
  authenticated footer's Product group (only Pricing remains there) since an
  authenticated user has nothing left to "evaluate" — Getting Started is
  still reachable from the authenticated nav itself.
- **Mobile bottom nav** stays at exactly 4 items (Garage, History, Plan,
  Account — `surfaces.mobileBottomNav: true`). Shops & Services and Getting
  Started are deliberately *not* bottom-nav items; they're reached through
  contextual entry points instead (Garage app bar, Settings, and the
  maintenance add/edit flow for Shops & Services; the onboarding flow and
  header/footer links for Getting Started).

### Terminology boundary: display language vs. stable identifiers

The capability vocabulary is a **presentation-layer** rename. It never
touches persisted data, backend contracts, or existing route paths — only
what's rendered on screen. Identifiers that stay internal, unchanged, and
must never be renamed to match display copy:

- Firestore field `preferredProviders`
- Callable `getLocalServiceProvidersCallable`
- Mobile class `LocalProvidersService`
- Persisted enum value `performedBy: 'mechanic'` (union: `'self' | 'mechanic' | 'business'`)
- Every existing route path (legacy paths redirect via `<Navigate replace />` rather than being renamed)

Help content follows the same boundary: FAQ entries use current display
language, but retired terms (Timeline, Upcoming Tasks, Mechanic, Profile,
Service Providers) are kept searchable via a `legacyTerms` field so users
who still think in the old vocabulary can find the right answer, without
those terms reappearing as display copy.

### Getting Started completion model

The spec's 6 onboarding milestones are shipped as **static/contextual copy
only** — no new persisted per-milestone completion state, no feature flag.
Two milestones (account created, first vehicle added) already have a live,
Firestore-derived signal; the rest (including "reviewed Service History")
have no live-derivable signal anywhere in the data model today. Building a
partial checklist — some steps checkmarked live, others permanently
unchecked — would be more confusing than a plain static list. The existing
single `onboarding_completed_$uid` boolean (SharedPreferences) remains the
only persisted onboarding state.

### Mobile analytics: explicitly deferred

Mobile has no analytics infrastructure today (no `firebase_analytics`
dependency, no event-logging wrapper, no `logEvent` calls anywhere in
`packages/mobile`). The web-side `capability_id` analytics dimension added
alongside this vocabulary is web-only; adding mobile analytics is a
separate, larger initiative to be scoped on its own rather than a
side-effect of a navigation rename.
